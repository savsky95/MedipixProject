Make sure to save (atleast) 1 dsc file for records of your dac settings and other device controls-> otherwise put all the non-extension files together and give them a txt or csv extension. Those are the matrix files which for the timepix or medipix2 is 256 x 256 and refers to the pixels of the detector. "
